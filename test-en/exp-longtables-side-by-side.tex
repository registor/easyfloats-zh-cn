% !TeX program = pdflatex

% This is a rather advanced example which shows several things:
% 1) How to auto generate a table in (La)TeX.
%    I am writing the table to a temporary file, then loading it with \input.
%    \write expands everything, even macros with a \noexpand in front of them.
%    I am using \string to avoid undesired expansion.
%    Saving the table in a macro or token register instead might be easier.
%    The \appto macro defined by the etoolbox package might be useful for that.
% 2) How to put two longtables side by side by placing them in the same object.
%    The most interesting part about that is the use of \cmidrule in table head style.
%    I have redefined table head style using \objectset instead of in the argument of
%    tableobject in order to avoid the need for \string.
% 3) How to use \objectset locally.
%    The use of \begingroup and \endgroup makes no difference in this example but
%    would keep the redefinition of table head style local if the document was longer.
%
% Please note that this usage is not exactly user friendly
% because when the reader has reached the end of column 1
% they must jump back to the top of the table which is 5 pages earlier.
